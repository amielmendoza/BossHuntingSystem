# Backend Authorization Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the authorization policies and access control implemented across all backend controllers.

## üîê **Authorization Policies**

The system defines the following authorization policies in `Program.cs`:

### **Core Policies**
- **`Admin`** - Full access to everything (Admin role only)
- **`User`** - Basic authenticated access (User or Admin role)
- **`ReadOnly`** - Read-only access to data (User or Admin role)
- **`Write`** - Write access for data modification (Admin role only)

### **Specialized Policies**
- **`BossManagement`** - Boss-related operations (Admin role only)
- **`MemberManagement`** - Member-related operations (Admin role only)
- **`Notifications`** - Notification system access (Admin role only)
- **`SystemAdmin`** - System-level operations (Admin role only)
- **`DataExport`** - Data export functionality (Admin role only)

| `/history` | GET | `ReadOnly` | Get boss defeat history (authenticated users) |
| `/history/{id}` | GET | `ReadOnly` | Get specific boss defeat record (authenticated users) |
| `/{id}` | GET | `ReadOnly` | Get specific boss details (authenticated users) |

| `/` | GET | `ReadOnly` | Get all members (authenticated users) |
| `/{id}` | GET | `ReadOnly` | Get specific member details (authenticated users) |
| `/` | POST | `MemberManagement` | Create new member (Admin only) |
| `/{id}` | PUT | `MemberManagement` | Update member (Admin only) |
| `/{id}` | DELETE | `MemberManagement` | Delete member (Admin only) |

### **4. VisionController** (`/api/vision`)

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features**

### **Authentication**
- JWT Bearer token authentication
- Token validation on every request
- Automatic token expiration handling
- Secure token generation with proper claims

### **Authorization**
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Policy-based authorization
- Granular permission control
- Automatic access denial for unauthorized requests

### **Audit Logging**
- All authorization decisions are logged
- User actions are tracked with username and timestamp
- Failed authorization attempts are logged
- Comprehensive error logging for security events

## üîë **User Roles**

### **Admin Role**
- Full access to all endpoints
- Can create, read, update, and delete all data
- System administration capabilities
- Notification management
- Data export functionality

### **User Role**
- Read access to most data
- Limited to viewing information
- Cannot modify system data
- Cannot access administrative functions

## üìä **Access Control Summary**

| Access Level | Public | User | Admin |
|--------------|--------|------|-------|
| **Login** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **View Data** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Modify Data** | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| **System Admin** | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| **Notifications** | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

## üö® **Security Considerations**

### **Public Access**
- Only the login endpoint is publicly accessible
- All other endpoints require valid authentication
- No sensitive data is exposed without authentication

### **Data Protection**
- All data access is logged for audit purposes
- Failed authorization attempts are tracked
- Sensitive operations require admin privileges
- Input validation on all endpoints

### **Token Security**
- JWT tokens have expiration times
- Tokens are validated on every request
- Secure token generation with proper signing
- No token storage on server (stateless)

## üîß **Configuration**

### **JWT Settings** (`appsettings.json`)
```json
{
  "Authentication": {
    "JwtSettings": {
      "SecretKey": "your-super-secret-key-with-at-least-32-characters",
      "Issuer": "BossHuntingSystem",
      "Audience": "BossHuntingSystemUsers",
      "ExpirationMinutes": 1440
    }
  }
}
```

### **User Configuration**
```json
{
  "Authentication": {
    "Users": [
      {
        "Username": "admin",
        "Password": "admin123",
        "Role": "Admin"
      },
      {
        "Username": "user",
        "Password": "user123",
        "Role": "User"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## üìù **Best Practices Implemented**

1. **Principle of Least Privilege** - Users only get access to what they need
2. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security (authentication + authorization)
3. **Audit Trail** - All actions are logged for security monitoring
4. **Input Validation** - All user inputs are validated and sanitized
5. **Error Handling** - Secure error messages that don't leak information
6. **Token Management** - Secure JWT token handling with proper expiration

## üöÄ **Future Enhancements**

1. **Dynamic Policy Management** - Runtime policy updates
2. **Fine-grained Permissions** - Permission-based access control
3. **Multi-factor Authentication** - Additional security layers
4. **Session Management** - Active session tracking and management
5. **Rate Limiting** - API rate limiting for security
6. **IP-based Restrictions** - Geographic and IP-based access control

## üìû **Support**
